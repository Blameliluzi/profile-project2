          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>My name is Nathaniel Morris and I am an aspiring back-end software developer.</p>

            <img class="codeCPU" src="Profile-project-2-images/coding.png" alt="coding computer">
            <h3>HTML and CSS Coding</h3>
            <p>I have knowledge of the web development languages of HTML and CSS and how to apply them in order to create some functioning
              projects such as this website!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row">
            <img class="videoGame" src="Profile-project-2-images/controller.png" alt="video game controller with purple background">
            <h3>I'm pretty good at games!</h3>
            <p>I enjoy playing video games and relying on my instincts and problem-solving skills to beat them.
              By that same point: I love competitive multiplayer games such as Smite, NBA 2k, and a wide variety of class-based role playing games.
            </p>

            <img class="teamSkill" src="Profile-project-2-images/teamwork.png" alt="Two stick figures working together to hold a gear.">
            <h3>I work <u>very</u> well with a team!</h3>
            <p>
              My past work experiences and disposition really allows me to mesh well with all kinds of team members. I truly believe that compatibility
              and cooperation with one's teammates can make or break the project success rate of a team (Pro tip:it's really as simple as just acknowledging
              one another's humanity and differences and showing mutual respect for each other's ideas.).

            <h3>Client Empathy</h3>
            <p>
              Even though this skil might <em>seem</em> unrelated to programming/software development, I would strongly disagree. In fact,
              the ability to think of the client - and I mean to <span class="empathy-span">really</span> put yourself in their shoes is an
              underrated skill that makes room for a lot less user complaints with the page, app, or product; as it allows the devs to accomodate
              needs that the user <em>themselves</em> didn't even know existed!

            <h3>Desire to be great</h3>
            <p>
              Through working multiple jobs, playing basketball competetitively, and just putting myself in environments that allow for competition
              in general: I find that I am in cnostant competition with myself; I havae this overwhelming desire to be better tomorrow than I was
              today, to be better now than I was 30 seconds ago, to just be better. Period. I love doing things that I'm good at - but, at the same
              time, - I love training myself to be good at aforementioned things and seeing it get easier to me the more I progress. I guess that's
              why I'm so into role-playing games; because, to me, life is like a role-playing game where you get 24 hours to train whatever skills you'd
              like. And your adeptness in said skill is completely up to how good you want to be in it..and when it comes to programming and anything
              having to do with coding or software: I don't want to be just good, <em>I want to be <span class="great">great</span></em>.
